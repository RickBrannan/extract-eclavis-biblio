Of these, St. Bartholomew was one of the twelve disciples, who, when he had preached the faith of Christ in India, which they call Felix, and had delivered to those people the Gospel written by Matthew, ended his life gloriously on the cross at Abarnopolis. His body was placed in a lead coffin and thrown in the sea, carried by divine providence as far as Sicily to the island of Lipari, and there it was found. From it sprang many miracles, and the faithful who approach it receive a sudden cure of their diseases, and they return cheerfully to their beds. Now Barnabas, who is also called Joseph in the Acts of the Apostles, was one of the Seventy, who was designated as Paul’s traveling companion. His name is interpreted as son of consolation. And he came from the tribe of Levi, born and brought up in the island of Cyprus. He was the first to preach the Gospel of Christ in Jerusalem, Rome, and Alexandria. Having gone to Cyprus, he was stoned by the Jews and Greeks and delivered to the fire. Then, when he had sailed to Ephesus, and had come to Paul, he informed him of the death of Barnabas. And Mark wept for him for a long time. It is said that he was buried here together with the Gospel of Matthew, which he had copied himself, and was afterwards found with the apostle’s body: from it the faithful received the privilege, that this island of theirs should not be subject to any other bishops, but should be ordained by their own bishop.</p>",
